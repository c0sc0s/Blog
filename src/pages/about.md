ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

This is cosine.

My major is SE(software Engineering).

I am proficient in using `js` , `react`, `redux`, `nextjs`, `koa`...

If you wanna contact me, you can follow me in the [github](https://github.com/c0sc0s).

By the way, I have recorded a JS tutorial. If you are interested in, you can power this link to [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/180492401?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).
